## Description

The Pokémon Data Analysis Project aims to investigate the relationships between Pokémon characters based on their attributes and statistics. The research employs quantitative methods, specifically data science and analysis techniques, to explore the Pokémon dataset comprehensively. The project addresses concerns raised by players about the evolving Pokémon franchise, emphasizing the challenge of creating optimal teams and the lack of incentives for researching Pokémon characters.

## Installation

This project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk

Install the required packages using the following command:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to perform in-depth data analysis on Pokémon characters, focusing on quantitative research methods. The primary objectives include:

-	Examining associations between Pokémon features and overall statistics and behavior in combat.
-	Investigating correlations between Pokémon features and types.
-	Exploring the impact of Pokémon features on their abilities.
-	Implementing machine learning algorithms on the Pokémon dataset to differentiate models and measure their performance.
- Determining the accuracy of the best-performing machine learning model through validation.

## File Descriptions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Pokemon_Data_Analysis.ipynb) that includes the code related to the analysis of Pokémon characters. The notebook covers data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, data preparation and transformation, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms.

## Results

The project's findings include optimal Pokémon combinations, insights into the importance of certain attributes such as weight and speed, and the performance of machine learning models in predicting Pokémon types and characteristics.

The detailed analysis findings and visualizations can be explored in the notebook.

## Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the required packages installed (see Installation). Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute each cell sequentially.
